### Disclaimers:
1. I am not a musically inclined person, so there's probably obvious mistakes made / issues with this system. If you're expecting a high fidelity experience this mod is not for you.
2. How Project Zomboid handles threads, framerates, and ticks can impact timings and playback may suffer because of this.
3. **This mod is meant as a casual instrument system.**<br>I won't be introducing a skill system integration, nor a way to manually play instruments.<br><br><sup>If you'd like a music mod that integrates well with a skill system (and a number of wonderful features) check out [Lifestyle](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997342681); If you'd like a much deeper immersive mod that requires manually playing instruments see [Bard Interactive Music](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3176639185).</sup>

### What is ABC Notation?

[ABC notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation) is a simple, text-based music format using letters and numbers to represent notes, rhythms, and other musical elements. It's designed to easily write and share music, especially melodies, without needing specialized music software.

**Notable Games that use ABC Notation Music Systems:**
- The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO)
- Starbound
- UnReal World
- Wurm Online
- Spacestation 13
